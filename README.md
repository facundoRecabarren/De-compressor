# De-compressor
This is a little implementation of a compressor and decompressor made in python.
You can compress/decompress files that have characters from A to Z (upperCase)and '.', ',', 'space', ';' and '\n'.
First it does a Burrows-Wheeler transformation, then Markov First Order with Fano.
It also calculates the entropy of the files.
You can download it and add some features.
